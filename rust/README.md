# Rust code for RabbitMQ tutorials

Here you can find the Rust code examples for [RabbitMQ
tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

The examples use [lapin](https://github.com/sozu-proxy/lapin) client library.

To successfully use the examples you will need a running RabbitMQ server.

## Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Code
Each tutorial is a separate crate where each source file corresponds to a
binary executable.
